<h1>Homework 8: Ratio Chloropleth</h1>

<h3>This map depicts poverty levels in Texas per 100 thousand residents and uses Equal 
Count intervals, so there are the same number of counties in each category. This provides 
a good understanding when trying to evaluate how counties compare using bracket-like groupings. 
However, since some groupings are smaller than others, it does not give as accurate a 
representation about distribution of poverty levels.</h3>

<h3>The next map uses Equal Interval classification to depict poverty levels in Texas per 100
    thousand residents. Equal interval classification creates classes that contain an equal amount of values. This
    type of classification is good for giving an accurate representation of distribution levels. However,
    if a large portion of the data is on the high or low end extreme, then the chloropleth might not provide
    useful visualization with which to compare counties.</h3>

<h3>The final map depcits poverty levels in Texas per 100 thousand residents using natural breaks
    classification. In this case, intervals are determined by naturally occurring groupings in the data.
    This ensures that coloration is depicted in a more informative way in cases where data might be clustered or
    follow a different pattern from the rest of the majority. However, since interval size varies widely, the
    classifications may not give as consistent information about distribution.
